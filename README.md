2. Kafka Topic/Queue with Zookeeper (fast, scalable, durable, and fault-tolerant publish-subscribe messaging system). 
  (a) Good to use asynchronus process like Auditing, Logging, SMS, Email etc.
  (b) Kafka provides horizontal scale through sharding. It shards a topic log into hundreds (potentially thousands) of partitions to thousands of servers. This sharding allows Kafka to handle massive load.
